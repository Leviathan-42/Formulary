# Module 3 Documents

Place your PowerPoint files (.pptx) in this folder.

The app will automatically detect and list them in the Documents tab.

## How to view PowerPoints

The document viewer requires a backend service or external viewer to render PowerPoint files. Options include:

1. **Microsoft Office Online Viewer**: `https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/embed.aspx?src=YOUR_FILE_URL`
2. **Google Docs Viewer**: `https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=YOUR_FILE_URL&embedded=true`
3. **Local server**: Set up a local backend to convert PPTX to HTML/PDF

For now, place your files here and they'll be ready when you add the viewing functionality.
